My name is Lukas. I am young, passionate full stack engineer who is keen on working with backend and devops.
As for a developer, Linux is my main OS, but Windows is no stranger to me too.
On another hand, I am a student of Information Architecture at UMCS in Lublin. Despite being a developer, I am qualified to do some basic networking - ICT technician here.

In my free time, I always improve my own skills while doing some private projects and helping others with gaining knowledge at any of IT fields.
I am also an aspiring cloud system engineer and what's more I am willing to learn ML and quantum computing - one, typical academic project is on its way.
